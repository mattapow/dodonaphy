# dodonaphy

Research into the use of hyperbolic embeddings for approximating phylogenetic posteriors

This code is under active research & development and not intended for production use for phylogenetic inference.

## getting started

The script `bin/test_dodonaphy.R` can be run from the top level repo directory to generate some simulated data and run dodonaphy. Several R packages are required including cmdstanr, phangorn, and ape. The build script `build.sh` can be run to build a CmdStan binary of dodonaphy.
